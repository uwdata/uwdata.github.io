## Northwest Visualization Day

The first-ever **Northwest Visualization Day** will be on **Friday May 9, 2025** at the University of Washington in Seattle.
This event is intended to bring together visualization researchers and practitioners across academia, industry, and government in the Pacific Northwest region.
The event is an opportunity to discuss the state-of-the-art in visualization, share projects, and build local community.

We plan to include everyone who submits the registration form.
However, in the unlikely event that we receive more sign-ups than we can accommodate, we may have to limit the number of attendees.
We will contact registrants well in advance should this become necessary.

We will share further updates, event details, and schedule information with registered participants as the date nears.
