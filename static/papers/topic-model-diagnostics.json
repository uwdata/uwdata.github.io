  "abstract": "The use of topic models to analyze domain-specific texts often requires manual validation of the latent topics to ensure that they are meaningful. We introduce a framework to support such a large-scale assessment of topical relevance. We measure the correspondence between a set of latent topics and a set of reference concepts to quantify four types of topical misalignment: junk, fused, missing, and repeated topics. Our analysis compares 10,000 topic model variants to 200 expert-provided domain concepts, and demonstrates how our framework can inform choices of model parameters, inference algorithms, and intrinsic measures of topical quality.",

  "caption": "We present a framework to support large-scale assessment of topic models. On the top left, the correspondence chart visualizes the alignment between human-identified concepts and machine-generated latent topics. We then introduce a process to automate the calculation of topical alignment, so that analysts can compare any number of models to known domain concepts and examine the deviations.",
