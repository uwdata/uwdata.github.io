  "abstract": "This paper extends previous work on focus+context visualizations of tree-structured data, introducing an efficient, space-constrained, multi-focal tree layout algorithm (\"TreeBlock\") and techniques at both the system and interactive levels for dealing with scale. These contributions are realized in a new version of the Degree-Of-Interest Tree browser, supporting real-time interactive visualization and exploration of data sets containing on the order of a million nodes.",

  "caption": "A Degree-Of-Interest Tree visualization of the Open Directory Project (http://dmoz.org). The tree contains over 600,000 nodes, laid out in a right-to-left orientation. Multiple foci have been selected and the various expanded branches are allocated as much space as possible given the display constraints.",
