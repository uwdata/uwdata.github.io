  "abstract": "Complex animated transitions may be easier to understand when divided into separate, consecutive stages. However, effective staging requires careful attention to both animation semantics and timing parameters. We present Gemini^2, a system for creating staged animations from a sequence of chart keyframes. Given only a start state and an end state, Gemini^2 can automatically recommend intermediate keyframes for designers to consider. The Gemini^2 recommendation engine leverages Gemini, our prior work, and GraphScape to itemize the given complex change into semantic edit operations and to recombine operations into stages with a guided order for clearly conveying the semantics. To evaluate Gemini^2's recommendations, we conducted a human-subject study in which participants ranked recommended animations from both Gemini^2 and Gemini. We find that Gemini^2's animation recommendation ranking is well aligned with subjects' preferences, and Gemini^2 can recommend favorable animations that Gemini cannot support.",

  "caption": "Staged animation timelines recommended by Gemini and Gemini2 for a transition where data are filtered and aggregated. The gray lines represents timelines, and the circles indicate start, end, and intermediate states. Gemini2 generates a keyframe chart (yellow circle) to separate two data transformations, which Gemini cannot do.",
